# Execution Model for Erlware Development

This page contains information on our process.  Basically how we turn
our ideas into reality.

## Communication for Users and Developers

The
[erlware-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en)
mailing list is the primary means of communication. Bugs and
enhancements from users should be placed on the appropriate issues
list at code.google.com/p/<project>.  Developers and users both should
subscribe to the issues they are interested in or have created by
using a *.  If a user or developer wants to monitor all issues they
should subscribe to
[erlware-artifacts@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-artifacts?hl=en).
To spur discussion on a particular issue, send an email to
[erlware-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en) or
[erlware-questions](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-questions?hl=en)
with a link to the issue, and ask that further discussion take place
on the issue itself; preferably not over email.


## Git and the Patch Process

First make sure to install msmtp (on debian or ubuntu just type sudo
apt-get install msmtp) Place the following in a config file with the
name .msmtprc in your home directory:

    account gmail
    host smtp.gmail.com
    auth on
    user <your username here>@gmail.com
    password <your password here>
    tls on
    tls_starttls on
    tls_certcheck off
    from <your username here>@gmail.com
    maildomain gmail.com
    account default : gmail

Now configure git to use msmtp.  You must do this for each separate
repository/project

    $ git config sendemail.smtpserver <path_to_msmtp>

For each project you will be submitting patches for you need to
configure a subject line.

    $ git config format.subjectprefix "<repo_name> PATCH"
