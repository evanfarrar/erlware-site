# New Erlang Release Checklist

This checklist is the list of steps that must be taken to upgrade the whole of
Erlware to a new Erlang release. So for example when R12B-3 became R12B-4 we
had to go through these steps to be compliant with it.

 * A new Faxien version must be published that codes in the version
   information for the new release.
 * Sinan must be compiled for the new release and published with the newly
   created Faxien version.
 * Dave and Dave - can you fill in this portion?
