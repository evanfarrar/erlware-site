# Third-Party Recommended Tools

## Emacs Modes and Tools

If you use Emacs to develop for the Erlware project, apart from our [erlang
mode]({relocatable:/tools/erlware-mode}), you might find useful next
tools to integrate with git.

### Emacs-git

[Emacs-git](http://mirror.nirv.net/emacs-git/) is an alternative git mode which
indicates graphically the git status of the current file and provides an
interactive interface for most of the basic operations.


### Gitsum

[Gitsum](http://github.com/chneukirchen/gitsum) is an Emacs mode which allows
you to do partial commits
([demo](http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2008/02/introducing-gitsum.html)).
