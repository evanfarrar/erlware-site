# Erlware Development Standards

Currently this is a hodgepodge placeholder for ideas and debate.  This
will be formatted and organized before 1.0 release.

This page is a guideline for those who want to develop Erlware itself.
These standards are a good reference for Erlang development in
general, but are a must for those developing on Erlware itself.

# Repository Standards

Since the 10th of April of 2008 we started to standardise our canonical
repositories layout. You might find some non-compliant repositories yet, but
in a reasonable time frame all will have, at least, next branches:

 * **master:** Current stable branch. It contains well tested stuff that is
   going to be in production. All releases are tags from this branch.

 * **next:** Public development HEAD. It contains stugg that will probably make
   it into `master` within a reasonable short period, but that are not
   necessarily well tested and might be broken or lack basic functionality
   (e.g. due to a in-progress refactoring).

`master` is always a subset of `next.` Changes should only get to master as
merges or cheery-picks from `next.`

Usually, `next` branch is the best reference if you plan to build some patches
for a repository. In any case, it is advisable to contact its maintainer before
to avoid painful conflicting merges.

# Coding Standards

**Terminal size:** 132 is the erlware standard.  Lines should not
  exceed this character max. For erlware-site, terminal size is 80 columns.

**Trailing whitespace:** You must not check in code with trailing whitespace
(space between last printable character and the end of the line). If you are
using emacs, you can use `delete-trailing-witespace` function to get rid of all
offending spaces in a buffer.

**Indentation:** We prefer the automatic indentation of
[erlware-mode]({relocatable:../tools/erlware-mode}).

# Documentation Standards

Erlware requires a certain level of documentation for all code
included in the central repository or as part of any Erlware project
such as Sinan or Faxien.  Basically the idea is that all API's should
be documented to a level that a user could figure out how to use them
without reading the code itself.  Examples of invocation are very
strongly recommended for all exported functions.

Erlware uses EDoc as its documentation standard.  All code must
compile with edoc.  To check and see if your docs compile you can use
the Sinan target **doc.**

## Module Documentation

Documentation for a module should appear at the top of the file.  This
is optional, but recommended.

## Function Documentation

All Exported functions should be documented. The following is an
example that includes the minimum level of documentation an exported
function should exhibit.


    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %% @doc I am a function and I do things.
    %% @spec my_func(List, Atom::atom()) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    %% @end
    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    my_func(List, Atom) ->
    ...

Additional documentation may be added as allowed by Edoc.  Any
additional user formatted explanation for the function should be
placed after @doc and before @spec such as in the following example.


    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %% @doc I am a function and I do such wonderful things.
    %% <pre>
    %% Example:
    %%  my_func([a, b], upgrade)
    %% </pre>
    %% @spec my_func(List, Atom::atom()) -> ok | {error, Reason}
    %% where
    %%       List = [string()]
    %% @end
    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    my_func(List, Atom) ->
    ...


We do encourage developers to document internal functions but it is
not required.  If you do document internal functions the documentation
should contain the @private tag as follows.


    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %% @private
    %% @doc I am an internal function and I do things to support an API.
    %% @spec my_internal_func(String::string()) -> ok | error
    %% @end
    %%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    my_internal_func(String) ->
    ...
