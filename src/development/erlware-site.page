# The Erlware Public Web Site

Erlware Web site is yet another open project in the Erlware suite. It is
generated from sources using [webgen][]. Those sources are kept in a git
repository, `erlware-site`, so that the development is open to all as any other
Erlware project.

Currently, erlware-site compiles only with webgen 0.4.x, there are issues to be
solved to comply with more modern webgen versions.

# Development Model

Follow the standard [workflow]({relocatable:standards.page}) to send your
patches to the [erlware-dev@googlegroups.com][development] mailing list.  The
site is generated periodically from the contents of the `master` branch. So
it will pass some time since your patches are approved until they show in the
site.

Since documentation is normally stable (at least much more stable than code)
`master` and `next` branches are usually the same. There are situations,
however, when `next` contains patches that are under revision or that are
incomplete yet. If you doubt witch branch you should use to generate patches to
contribute, drop some lines in the development list to ask.

# Documentation Structure

The goal is promoting Erlware as a whole and provide tutorials to let new people
start using Erlware without effort.

There are three sections:

  * Erlware section contains tutorials and reference information about
    erlware. That is, how to use the main tools (faxien, sinan, and, probably,
    erlware-mode) together to increase the productivity and quality of erlang
    projects. There are some subsections in there, with howtos, tutorials, and
    documentation about the Erlware project.

  * Tools section contains a place for each individual tool. Typically, each
    tool section has an introduction, one or more tutorials, and one or more
    reference manuals.

  * Developers section contains information and guidance on how to contribute to
    the Erlware project.

# Quick Guide

Follow next steps to clone erlware-site repository and generate a local copy of
the web site.

  1. Clone erlware-site

        git clone git://github.com/erlware/erlware-site.git

  1. Download and install ruby gems. It will probably be packetised for your
     GNU/Linux distribution (e.g. `apt-get install rubygems` in Debian). You may
     also need Ruby's development files to install some gems (`apt-get install
     ruby1.8-dev` in Debian).
  1. Install webgen and bluecloth (the markdown text-to-html engine). It is
     important to use a 0.4.x version of webgen.

        $ gem install --version 0.4.7 webgen
        $ gem install bluecloth

  1. Run webgen in the top level of the project (you may need to write the whole
  path to webgen):

        $ webgen _0.4.7_ run

Page sources are under `src`. They are written using [markdown][]
notation. After running webgen, the site root is in `output.`

Finally, if you are planning to contribute documentation, please:

  * Read other pages similar to the one you are going to write to get in touch
    with the structure, style, etc.
  * Drop some lines in [the development list][erlware-dev] if you plan to work
    some time changing stuff, to avoid collisions with other developers.
