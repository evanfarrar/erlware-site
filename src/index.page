# What's Erlware

Erlware is Erlang/OTP developer central. We are open source and mostly
MIT-licenced. At our core we host public repositories containing reliable Erlang
OTP-compliant applications. Our repositories enable developers to use software
written by the Erlang community and to publish and distribute their own software.

We also feature a number of supported projects developed by our members.  Most
notable right now are:

 * **Erlware Mode:** an enhanced emacs mode for Erlang development.
 * **Faxien:** the Erlang/OTP package manager.
 * **Sinan:** the Erlang/OTP build system.
