# What's Erlware

Erlware is Erlang/OTP developer central. We are open source and mostly MIT 
licenced. At our core we host public repositories containing reliable Erlang OTP 
complient applications. Our repositories enable developers to use software 
written by the erlang community and to publish and distribute their own software.  

We also feature a number of supported projects developed by our members.  Most 
notibly right now are:

 * Erlware Mode - an enhanced emacs mode for Erlang development
 * Faxien - the Erlang/OTP package manager
 * Sinan - the Erlang/OTP build system
