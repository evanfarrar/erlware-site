# What's Erlware

Erlware is Erlang/OTP developer central. We are open source and mostly
MIT-licenced. At our core we host public repositories containing reliable Erlang
OTP-compliant applications. Our repositories enable developers to use software
written by the Erlang community and to publish and distribute their own software.
