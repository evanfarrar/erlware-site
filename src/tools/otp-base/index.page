    "It is preferable to build an expensive residence on a foundation of sand 
     then to undertake the construction multiple software applications without 
     a common build structure and environment."

# Overview 

OTP Base is our make based build system as differentiated from Sinan is our 
pure Erlang flagship build system. The OTP Base is a build environment that 
supports the OTP way of building applications with the Erlang programming 
language. The reason to use OTP Base is that it makes creating OTP applications 
very simple and it is written with Make.  You no longer have to wade through 
docs trying to figure out what a .script file is for.  

OTP Base provides the following core tree structure which should be relatively 
familiar to those versed in the Erlang OTP

The release directory specific to an application contains further directories 
for configuration and logging.  These are discussed in more detail further on.

# Features

The main reasons to use OTP Base are:

  * Erlang/OTP build system written with Make
  * Enforces OTP standards and also automates them
  * Automated application and release generation
  * Easy to generate installable or publishable OTP Release packages
  * Good integration with Faxien

# Download

An OTP Base installer can be found at http://code.google.com/p/otp-base

# What's in a Name

We have established a tradition at Erlware in that we typically name our 
projects after historical figures that have something to do with the function 
of the software.  Sinan, Faxien, and Crary are all good examples of this 
convention. OTP Base has been around in one form or another for over 8 years.  
It has seen both production and hobby environments and has been used in one 
form or another by many erlang developers. It was around well before Eric and 
I ever decided to form Erlware or any of the core developers had heard of it. 
So even though OTP Base has a new face we are going to give grandfather a pass 
and let the name OTP Base stick (-:
