# Faxien Command List

This summary of commands first presents the commands that are most frequently
used followed by all remaining commands available through the Faxien commandline
interface.

# Frequently Used Command Summary

Type `faxien help commands` from the command line to get a list of Faxien
commands.

## help

    $ faxien help
    $ faxien help commands
    $ faxien help <command>

Prints out help information for Faxien.

## list

    $faxien list [search_type] [pattern]

Prints out all the applications that have the pattern specified.  If no pattern
is provided it lists all available applications and releases. Search type can be
either `normal` or `regexp.` A normal search like the following

    $ faxien list yaw

would yield "yaws" as a result.

    $ faxien list regexp y[aw]*s

would also yield "yaws," though why anyone would ever type such a
thing I don't know.

## install-release

    $ faxien install-release <release_name|path_to_package> [version]

This command fetches a release from a respository and installs it onto
the local file system if you specify a release name. The default
location is `/usr/local/erlware.` If you specify the path to an
untarred package or a tarred package with the extension `.tar.gz` Faxien
will install that package from the hard disk.

**Note** Note if you want to install for an erts vsn other than the default
erts vsn you must tell faxien that. To see the default erts vsn use 
`faxien show-target-erts-vsn` and to set a new one use 
`faxien set-target-erts-vsn <erts-vsn>`. For example 5.6.1 is for R12B-1.

**Example Usage**

    $ faxien install-release sinan  ## Installs the release from a remote repository
    $ faxien install-release /home/martin/sinan.tar.gz  ## installs a local release tarball


## install-app

    $ faxien install-release <app_name|path_to_app_package> \[version\]

This command fetches an application from a respository and installs it
onto the local file system.  This will also install an application
package from the local file system.

**Example Usage**

    $ faxien install-app fslib  ## Installs the application from
                                ## a remote repository
    $ faxien install-app fslib 5.7.3 ## Installs version 5.7.3 of the
                                     ## application from a remote repository
    $ faxien install-app /home/martin/fslib.tar.gz  ## installs a local
                                                    ## application tarball


## publish

    $ faxien publish [repo_url] <path_to_app_or_release> [request_timeout]

Publishes a pre-built application or a release to a remote unguarded
repository. This function tries to infer whether the package is a
architecture specific application, a platform independent application,
or a release. Release packages follow the structure for releases as
outlined by erlware.org.  A release directory must be of the form
`<release_name>-<release_vsn>` in order to be published.  An application
directory may be of that form but does not have to be as this function
will determine the version number via the app file provided in the
ebin directory of the application. Once published the code is then
available for immediate use by any application is erlware repo
compatible such as Sinan.

**Note** Timeout values are in milliseconds

**Example Usage**

    $ faxien publish /home/martin/my_app.tar.gz  ## Publish a tarred
                                                 ## application package to the
                                                 ## configured default remote
                                                 ## repo
    $ faxien publish /home/martin/my_release 10000  ## Publish an untarred
                                                    ## release package to the
                                                    ## configured default
                                                    ## remote repo with a
                                                    ## request timeout of 10
                                                    ## seconds
    $ faxien publish http://erlware.org/writable /home/martin/my_release  ## publish
                                                    ## an untarred release
                                                    ## package to a specific
                                                    ## remote repository

## set-target-erts-vsn

    $ faxien set-target-erts-vsn <erts-vsn> 

Sets the upper limit on the erts vsn that faxien will seek to pull packages 
for. For example if a user wants to target R12B for which the latest release is
R12B-1 which carries an erts vsn of 5.6.1 the target erts vsn should be set to
5.6.1. Faxien will then seek to pull packages in decending order from 5.6.1 to 
5.6. 

**Note** to see the current target erts vsn type `faxien show-target-erts-vsn`

**Example Usage**

    $ faxien set-target-erts-vsn 5.5.5
