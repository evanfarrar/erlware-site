# Getting Started

The main reason to use Portius are:

 - Allow users to host a read only repository containing vetted apps and a write only repo containing published un-tested packages.
 - Validate packages and move them from the write only repo to the read only repo.
 - Generate documentation that is placed in a known location

Assuming you already have a web-server fronting at least one repo we will progress from there. The first step is to install Portius on your system. This is done via

    faxien install-release portius

Next Portius needs to be configured. To do this we edit "erlware/release_packages/portius/<vsn>/release/sys.config". The config section for Portius is listed below.

    {portius,
     [
      {inspection_frequency, 240000},
      {transitions,
       [
        %% <from-repo>, <to-repo>, <generated-docs-base-dir>
        {"/var/www/htdocs/repo/writable", "/var/www/htdocs/repo/pub", "/var/www/htdocs/erlware-doc"}
       ]
      }
     ]
    }

By default Portius is configured to check the <from-repo> every 4 minutes (240,000 milliseconds). The next entry is for 'transitions' which define a repo to transition files from, a repo to transition them to, and a location for any documentation that is generated along the way. Alter the default transition to mirror your system setup.

Once this is done all that is left to do is to run the server.  This is done by typing "portius" on the command line (assuming erlware/bin is in your path).  By default Portius logs to portius.err_log and portius.sasl_log in your machines temporary directory. You may view those files to see how things are progressing.
