# Overview

Portius is simply about taking packages from one repo, filtering out
the bad ones, extracting things like docs, and finally putting them
into another repo in the correct place.

# Features

 - Move packages from one repo to another.
 - Validate the packages before moving them
 - Generate documentation for each application package and place it in a known location.

# Whats in a Name?

The 17th century A.D. saw the first known illustration of [sand
filters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_filter). The Italian
physician Lucas Antonius Portius wrote the Soldier’s Vade Mecum in
1685, which details a multiple sand filtration method. In this
illustration, Portius described three pairs of sand filters—each pair
consisting of a downward-flow filter and an upward-flow filter.

Mr. Portius was a pioneer in filter design and so it is fiting that he
is the namesake of the Portius application. This application is
responsible for making sure that only well formed pure OTP apps make
their way into our public repositories.
