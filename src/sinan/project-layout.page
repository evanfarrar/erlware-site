Sinan projects have a pretty flexible layout. For the most part you
can put your OTP applications anywhere you like. The only real
requirement is that the [Build Config]({relocatable:
build-config.page}) be at the root of your project. I tend to put my
OTP apps in a lib directory so I will give an example of a project
with that format.

Lets start out with project foo, that has libraries bar1 and bar2. My
layout would look as follows


    foo
     |-_build.cfg
     |-lib
        |-bar1
           |-ebin
              |- bar1.app
              |- *.beam
           |-src
              |-*.erl
        |-bar2
           |-ebin
              |- bar2.app
              |- *.beam
           |-src
              |-*.erl


This layout works just fine. However, you could just as easily have
the OTP applications at the same level as the build config or buried
under twenty superfluous directories. It doesn't matter. Sinan will
discover your projects without any problem at all.

Now lets say you have a very simple project that consists of just a
single OTP application. You don't really want it bury it under a
normal layout you just want to build right in the OTP app itself. This
is just fine. All you need to do is drop a build config into the top
level of the OTP app and you are golden.


    bar1
     |-_build.cfg
        |-ebin
           |- bar1.app
           |- *.beam
        |-src
           |-*.erl

Things will be built into the build directory just like normal and all
of the usual tasks work.
