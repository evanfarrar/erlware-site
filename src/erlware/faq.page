# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the relation between sinan and OTP Base?

Sinan is our flagship 100% erlang build system.  OTP Base is a make based build
system.  We encourage most people to use Sinan.  There are those that need make,
or simply like make, OTP Base is for them.

There are other differences as well.  OTP Base does not do any fetching of apps,
dependency checking, or the like.  It relies on the applications found on the
system, in the faxien repo most significantly to find all its dependencies.
There are a few other differences but in general OTP Base is less full featured
than Sinan though it does have its own flair.  OTP Base is still quite easy to
use, it generates applications and releases for you, it handles all fundamental
aspects of building OTP software.  I personally use Sinan for most of my
projects but I use OTP Base for about 1/4th of them.  They are two different
takes on the same thing - OTP complient Erlang build systems.
