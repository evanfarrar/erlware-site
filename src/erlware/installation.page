# Erlware installation

Simply download the faxien bootstraper for your platform from
[Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/faxien/downloads/list) and run it.

    $ ./faxien_launcher # installs to `/usr/local/erlware.`

You may use `--prefix|-p <directory>` to install in non default location.  Also,
you may add `<prefix>/bin` to your path to be able to execute erlware
applications without typing the whole path to them.
