# Erlware installation

Simply download the faxien bootstraper for your platform from
[Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/faxien/downloads/list) and run it.

    $ sh ./faxien_launcher # installs to /usr/local/erlware

By default, the installer places all files under the prefix `/usr/local/erlware`.
You may add a single argument to the launcher script to specify an
alternate prefix.

    $ sh ./faxien_launcher /opt/erlware # installs to /opt/erlware

Also, it is a good idea to add `<prefix>/bin` to your PATH to be able
to execute Erlware applications without typing the whole path to them.
