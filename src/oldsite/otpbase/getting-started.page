# Getting Started (Installing OTP Base)

The first step is to pull down the featured OTP Base download from its
[home at Google Code](http://code/google.com/p/otp-base). Next you are
going to need to install two applications the first is FSLib and the
second is G.A.S. The easiest way to install these is to use the
[Faxien]({relocatable:/oldsite/faxien/index.page}) package manager.


    faxien install_app fslib
    faxien install_app gas


By default these two applications will be installed into
_/usr/local/erlware/lib/_.  If you have installed Faxien into an
alternate location then these apps will be installed in
_<alternate_location>/erlware/lib_.  OTP Base needs to know where they
are installed.  For the default case you don't need to do anything,
OTP Base assumes the default location.  If you are using the alternate
location then you need to do one of two things

  - Set the environment variable ERLWARE_HOME to <alternate_location>/erlware
  - edit the ERLWARE_HOME default value in otp-base/build/otp.mk to be <alternate_location>/erlware

Once you have done this OTP Base will know where to look for system
wide installed applications to use in building and creating releases.

The next thing to do is create an application with
otp-base/tools/utilities/appgen.


    ./appgen my_app my


This will create...
