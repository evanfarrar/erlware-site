# Installing a package with Faxien

Faxien has two main missions, one is installing packages the other is
publishing them for others to install.  Here we will cover the first
of the two main missions, installing packages. There are two types of
packages **applications** and **releases**.  For more info on
[[:documentation:release_anatomy|the structure and definition of a
release see here]].  The most basic way to install a release package
is as follows:

    faxien install <release_name>

The most basic way to install an application package is as follows:


    faxien install_app <app_name>


Both of these commands will result in the latest version of the package specified being installed from a remote repository into the erlware directory (in the case of the applications erlware/lib).  Most of the time this is all you will ever need.


# Other useful types of installation

The cases illustrated above are the basic cases for installation of packages.  There are a also number of other useful options to know about.

## Local Installation

Faxien is equally at home installing packages right from the local file system as it is from a remote repository. Lets say you have an application called my_app-1.0.3 sitting on the local hard drive in the work directory, and it needs to be installed into the erlware directory, this can accomplished by:


    faxien install_app work/my_app-1.0.3


Faxien will recognize that you are pointing to an application that resides locally and will install it directly instead of consulting an online repository.  The same applies for releases


    faxien install work/my_release-2.1.3


This will install home/martin/opt/my_release-2.1.3 from /home/martin/opt into the erlware directory. **Note* packages to be installed by Faxien must contain version numbers** As you know releases are a collection of applications, and these applications reside under the lib directory of a release.  If a local release does not have a lib directory Faxien will fetch the applications that the particular release relies on from remote repositories.  Similarly if the lib directory does not contain all of the applications the release relies upon Faxien will fetch the missing applications from remote repositories.

## Versioned Remote Installation

Faxien install commands will also take a version argument if a specific version of a package is to be installed.


    faxien install sinan 0.8.3

or

    faxien install_app gas 6.7.0

For a full and detailed listing of all installation command see the Faxien command summary page.
