# Getting Started (Installing the Faxien package)

First things first. Faxien needs to be installed on the local system.
In order to do this you must first download the Faxien bootstrap file
for your system architecture and OS.  Click on the featured download
at the [Faxien Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/faxien)
page. Once you have the Faxien bootstrap execute

    sh ./faxien-bootstrap-<platform>.sh


Running the above will cause Faxien to be installed into /usr/local/erlware.

Faxien can be installed in an alternate location by if the bootstrap is given a prefix.  For example if I want Faxien to be installed into /home/martin/erlware I would run the following command:


    sh ./faxien-bootstrap-<platform>.sh /home/martin/erlware



# A tour of the installed Faxien release

Lets take a look at what the install script has done.  Change directories into /usr/local/erlware (if you used the --prefix switch then change to the directory you specified).  Execute a directory listing in that directory.


    /usr/local/erlware$ ls
    bin  lib erts  log release_packages tmp


In the erlware directory we can see the following directories:
 - **release_packages** contains the faxien release which houses the .boot file, and Faxien's configuration.
 - **bin** directory contains a soft link to the "faxien" script which lies in faxien-0.10.0/bin.
 - **lib** contains all of the applications the faxien release requires to run.
 - **log** contains the faxien.err_log and faxien.sasl_log files which are a great help in trouble shooting.
 - **tmp** some housekeeping which outside the scope of this document.

It is advisable that you add the erlware/bin directory to your path so that you can execute Faxien and any other release you install without having to type the full path to the executable file every time you need it.
