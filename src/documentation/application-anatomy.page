# Application Details

An OTP application must have at least the following directories.


  * **src/**: contains erlang sources (.erl files)
  * **ebin/**: compiled beam files are placed here

An OTP application may also have any one of the following directories.

  * **include/**: contains shared .hrl files
  * **c_src/**: contains C sources
  * **priv/**: contains files you want at run-time

# Anatomy of an Application

OTP applications under a Sinan project must follow a few conventions. They
have a src and an ebin directory and they must have an
`ebin/<appname>.app`. The erlang source files, under `src`, should follow
the OTP naming conventions. One options is: ff the name of the application is my_app
then there should exist an erlang file with behaviour(application) of
the name `my_app.erl`. All other files should have a prefix representing
the namespace of the application.

Under the `ebin` directory you must also find the `<appname>.app`
file. This file is used heavily by the sinan build system as well as
otp. To find out more about this see the documentation at
http://www.erlang.org.

Following a build the `<project-root>/_build` directory will be
created. Under the build directory will be several directories used by
the build system. In this case the 'apps' directory will be of
interest. In the `<project-root>/_build/development/apps/<appname-vsn>` will be a
distribution read version of the app. The `ebin` directory will contain
the .app and .beam files. The src directory will contain symlinks to
this source and other required directories will be present.
