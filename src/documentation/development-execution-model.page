# Execution Model for Erlware Development

This page contains information on our process.  Basically how we turn our ideas into reality.

Erlware is comprised of several projects, Sinan, Faxien, and the erlware-mode are examples of this.  Each project has an owner/maintainer. The project owner is responsible for all aspects of the project and has discression on all things that are not covered explicitly by Erlware standards. 

Erlware uses the Git version control system. Git is at the heart of our development process. We favor promoting community interaction and development of projects. This is fostered through patch based development.  All developers work on their own local branch of a given project.  They submit patches containing their changes to the erlware-dev list for comments. The code is ultimately accepted or rejected by the project owner and merged into the cannonical repository. 

For some information on how to setup patch emailing take a look at the following link:

# Communication for Users and Developers 

The [erlware-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en) mailing list is the primary means of communication. Bugs and enhancements from users should be placed on the appropriate issues list at code.google.com/p/<project>.  Developers and users both should subscribe to the issues they are interested in or have created by using a *.  If a user or developer wants to monitor all issues they should subscribe to [erlware-artifacts@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-artifacts?hl=en).  

To spur discussion on a particular issue, send an email to [erlware-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en) or [erlware-questions](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-questions?hl=en) with a link to the issue, and ask that further discussion take place on the issue itself; preferably not over email.
