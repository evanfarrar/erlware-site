# Execution Model for Erlware Development

This page contains information on our process.  Basically how we turn
our ideas into reality.

## Communication for Users and Developers =====

The
[erlware-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en)
mailing list is the primary means of communication. Bugs and
enhancements from users should be placed on the appropriate issues
list at code.google.com/p/<project>.  Developers and users both should
subscribe to the issues they are interested in or have created by
using a *.  If a user or developer wants to monitor all issues they
should subscribe to
[erlware-artifacts@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-artifacts?hl=en).
To spur discussion on a particular issue, send an email to
[erlware-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-dev?hl=en) or
[erlware-questions](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-questions?hl=en)
with a link to the issue, and ask that further discussion take place
on the issue itself; preferably not over email.
